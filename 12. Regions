What object is responsible for monitoring regions?

What are the maximum number of regions you can monitor for in a single app?

...What would be one way around this limit?

What are the two functions that notify you about a user entering/exiting a region?

**How I made this:**

open p-list file - create new row and paste the privacy statements there, name them (e.g. hello world)

type "import MapKit" @ top

create outlets

type "let locationManager = CLLocationManager()" above VDL

type "locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
        locationManager.delegate = self
        locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()" below VDL
        
type "extension ViewController: CLLocationManagerDelegate {
        
        func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
          print(locations.last!)" below
          
file, new, file..., GPXfile, save 

Go to main DMD homepage and click 'simulating location', copy and paste the code over all of the location.gpx code

On storyborad, click Mapview and open attributes inspection. check 'user location'

under VDL, type " map.userTrackingmode = .follow"

How to turn on little blue arrow: top left click name of project and click "edit scheme", options, default location, select location

Under mapView... type "let coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 0, longitude: 0)"

go to gpx file, copy the second lat and long and paste in code

below "let coordinate..." type " let region = CLCircularRegion(center: coordinate, radius: 100, identifier: "Pier")
        locationManager.startMonitoring(for: region)"

below type "   func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didEnterRegion region: CLRegion) {
            print(region.identifier)"
